# Guide to Starting Hackathons

Resources and tips to take when starting a hackathon. 
All of these tips should be adapted to each place. 

## Steps
  1. Announcing the event 
  2. Marketing
  3. Sponsorships
  4. Registration 
  5. Event 
  
## Announcing the event. 

- Try to announce the event as early as possible, try to keep at least some months before the event. You need the time to acquire sponsors mostly, which is the most important part. 

- Steps to do:
  1. Give the approx date of when the event would be.
  2. Create a deck to get sponsors (more on it later)
  3. Basic branding (logo etc..) and create social media pages for the event 
  4. Start creating a website
  
 ## Marketing
 
 You have two sets of people you want to reach out to, sponsors and participants. Here Marketing is for participants. 
 1. Post on social media regularly for eg: each sponsor you get, each mentor or speaker you get. You might not know which social media works, hence try all of them. Try to automate the pipeline as much as possible.
 2. Reach out to specific groups, you can post in social media groups of programmers such as hackathon hackers, Reddit, WhatsApp groups where generally people who go to hackathon hangout. But don't spam. 
 3. Reach out to universities. One way to formally mail director@college.com or post in social media groups of college or have a campus ambassador outreach. You can offer goodies in return for the outreach. 
 4. Tie up with organisations which can promote your hackathons, some few are MLH, devfolio, devpost, hackerearth etc. Remember there is no such thing as free lunch. In general, they become sponsors. 
 
 ## Sponsorships
 
 The difference between a great hackathon and an average is one is based on how well you do this.
 
 Sponsors are of 4 types
 1. Monetary - They provide money 
 2. Goodies - They can send T-Shirts, stickers etc...
 3. Mentors - People to give a talk and mentor during the event, typically they pay for logistics. 
 4. Services - These are mostly like winners or participants of the hackathon will get the paid service for free. eg: a sketch licence to top 10 winners etc.
 
 To get a sponsor you need to 
 
 1. Make a sponsorship deck - with multiple tier and benefits for each tier. Sponsors typically want -> promotion on social media, website, logo in posters (physical or digital), ability to get emails of participants, to hire from a hackathon, name in title etc... 
 2. Reach out to people, these are the most common - 
        - Cold email: you can use platforms like clearbit and get an email of people in the company and mail them. (do try to send a better cold email - see marketingexamples.com).
        - Find list of companies which sponsored hackathons near you, and mail them at first. The probability of getting a good reply will be higher. 
        - Get a contact within the company such as alumni or a friend and ask them or ask GitHub if you have a campus ambassador. 
 3. Website - before sending sponsorship mails make sure you at least have a coming soon website with the list of previous year sponsors. It is hard to get sponsors when you don't make much in the past.  
 
 ## Registrations
 
 - Registration can be done using many platforms such as devfolio, devpost etc...
 - Do make sure you close registration at least a few days before the event if the participants need time to commute to the event. 
 - Having multiple people screen is a good way to decrease bias. 
 - Travel reimbursements are the best way to increase registrations. 
 
 ## Event
 
 1. Make sure you have working internet, make sure your internet can stand the number of people- lack of internet is the biggest reason for a bad hackathon.
 2. Conducting workshops
    - demo workshops: The best type of workshop. Suppose if you have a sponsor with a prize. Then they can show how to use their product. 
    - general talks or workshops: People talk about something cool, generally expect low attendance for such events. 
  During workshops is one of the best time to give out goodies of the event. This can boost participation. 
  3. Goodies distribution: In general the best way is to give in many steps. for eg: during registration, during events, before the end of hackathon etc... 
  4. Prizes: Try to make sure, you let the winners know by when they can get prizes. It's very frustrating when you don't get a prize. You can also send people certificates. I tend to prefer automatically generating certificates and sending them via email. 
  5. Food: Make sure there are snacks in between or coffee etc. during the non-food times. Having coupons for breakfast, lunch and dinner can help if your event is in an open space where many events are happening to moderate rush.
